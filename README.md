# FloraAndFaunaGenerator
A "Scientifically Accurate" Flora and (soon to be) Fauna Generator made with python.

Instead of rewriting my original one from scratch, I refactored and expanded https://github.com/cutecprog's version.

I broke up the RollInterface, and the Flora into individual classes.

I've also added a str method in the Flora class to output human readable text to the console.

I'm in the process of adding the FaunaTables, and the Fauna Class as well as Fungus Tables and Fungus Class.
